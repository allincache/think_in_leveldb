  return (static_cast<uint32_t>(buffer[0])) |
         (static_cast<uint32_t>(buffer[1]) << 8) |
         (static_cast<uint32_t>(buffer[2]) << 16) |

These two functions are for encoding and decoding 32-bit unsigned integers.

The `EncodeFixed32` function is designed to encode (or serialize) a 32-bit unsigned integer (`uint32_t`) into a byte stream. Specifically, it stores each byte of the 32-bit integer separately into the memory address pointed to by `dst`. The storage order of bytes is from the least significant byte (LSB) to the most significant byte (MSB), which is also known as little-endian byte order.

The `DecodeFixed32` function is used to decode (or deserialize) a 32-bit unsigned integer from a byte stream. It reads 4 bytes from the memory address pointed to by `ptr` and combines them into a 32-bit unsigned integer. The reading order of bytes is also from LSB to MSB, following the little-endian byte order.

In summary, these two functions can be used for converting between byte streams and 32-bit unsigned integers, which is very useful in scenarios like network communication and file storage. It's important to note that these functions assume the use of little-endian byte order, which is the default byte order on most modern computer systems. However, it's crucial to pay extra attention in certain specific systems (such as some network devices and mainframes) where the byte order might be different.

Additionally, both functions utilize `reinterpret_cast` for type conversion. This is a type of conversion method in C++ that allows converting pointers of any type to pointers of any other type. However, it requires caution as it doesn't perform any type checking or conversion; it simply changes the pointer type. In this context, it's used to convert `char*` type pointers to `uint8_t*` type pointers, facilitating byte-level data manipulation.
