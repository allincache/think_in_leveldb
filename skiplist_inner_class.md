In the `SkipList` class, an inner class `Iterator` is used, which enhances encapsulation and facilitates access to all permissions of its outer class. The inner class can access the private members and methods of its outer class, enabling the iterator to traverse the `SkipList` more efficiently. At the same time, this hides the implementation details of the `SkipList`, exposing only the necessary traversal interfaces to external use.

In C++, defining one class (inner class) inside another class (outer class) serves multiple purposes. This practice is typically used in the following situations:

1. **Encapsulation**:
   The inner class can serve as an implementation detail of the outer class, hidden from the users of the outer class. This allows the interface of the outer class to be more concise, while the implementation details of the inner class are not exposed to users of the outer class.

2. **Access Control**:
   The inner class can access the private and protected members of the outer class, which is not possible for other classes outside the outer class. This access privilege provides more flexibility for the inner class in implementing certain functionalities.

3. **Namespace Isolation**:
   The inner class is defined within the scope of the outer class, so its name does not conflict with other names in the external scope. This helps avoid naming conflicts, especially in large projects.

4. **Hiding Implementation Details**:
   If the implementation details of the inner class are not important to the users of the outer class, defining the inner class inside the outer class can hide these details, making the interface of the outer class clearer.

5. **Close Association with the Outer Class**:
   If the inner class is closely related to the outer class in functionality, defining the inner class inside the outer class can express this relationship, making the code organization more reasonable.

6. **Auxiliary Classes in Template Programming**:
   In template programming, inner classes are often used as auxiliary classes to implement complex template metaprogramming techniques.

**Specific Example**:

The provided example demonstrates a `Car` class with a private member `parts`, a vector of strings representing car components. The `Car` class also contains an inner class `Engine` representing the car's engine. The `Engine` class has private members `type` and `horsepower` representing the engine type and horsepower, respectively.

The `Engine` class has a `showSpecs` method to display engine specifications. Additionally, it has an `addPart` method that accepts a reference to a `Car` object and a part name as parameters, adding the part to the `Car` object's `parts` list. Notably, the `addPart` method allows the `Engine` class to access the private member `parts` of the `Car` class, showcasing the ability of inner classes to access private members of outer classes.

The `Car` class has a `setEngine` method that accepts a reference to an `Engine` object as a parameter and calls the `Engine` object's `addPart` method, adding "Engine" to the `parts` list of the `Car` object.

Finally, the `main` function creates a `Car` object and an `Engine` object, adds the engine to the car, displays the engine specifications, and shows all parts of the car, which should include "Engine".
